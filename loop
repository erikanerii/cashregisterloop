/* Write a complete C++ program (including comments) to compute the contents of a cash register at the end of the day.
 At the start of the day, your program should ask the user for:
 Total starting amount of cash in the register.
 Your program should then loop for 5 customers.
 For each customer (each iteration in the loop):
 1. Ask the total value of the bill.
 2. Check if the user is paying with cash or debit card
 a. If the user is paying with cash, add the amount to the register.
 b. If the user is paying with a debit card, ask if the user wants cash back. If yes, ask for the amount of cash back and subtract this 
amount from the register.
 After the last iteration, your program should display the following:
 1) Total of all sales.
 2) Total amount of all cash paid to the register.
 3) Total amount of all cash given back.
 4) Final balance of cash in the register.
 Extra credit: You do not know how many customers there are! Use a trailer value or ask the user if there are more customers. Your code 
should work for ANY number of customers.
